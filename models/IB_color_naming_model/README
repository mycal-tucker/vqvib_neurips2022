Model
=====

The model .pkl file contains a python dict object with the following fields:

- pM		capacity-achieving prior over color chips
- pU_M		speaker's mental representations, m(u)
- betas		the values of beta used for the reverse deterministic annealing schedule
- IB_curve	the IB curve defined by (I_beta(M;W), I_beta(W;U))
- qW_M		the optimal IB encoders (color naming systems) for each value of beta

See the paper for more details.
